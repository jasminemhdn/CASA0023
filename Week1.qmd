# Introduction to Remote Sensing

## Remote Sensing Definition and How it Works

Generally, remote sensing is defined as acquiring information from a distance such as satellites, planes, drones, or handheld devices. Ruth DeFries (2013) describes remote sensing as the practice of obtaining information about the Earth’s surface, using images acquired from airborne or spaceborne vehicles by measuring reflected, emitted, or returned electromagnetic radiation. In the context of geospatial analysis, remote sensing refers to data acquired from the sensor in earth’s satellite.

Remote sensing mainly captures the electromagnetic (EM) radiation that is reflected from earth’s surface. EM wave is an energy that travels through the light. All matters with absolute temperature above zero (0 K) reflect and emit EM waves of various length (J. M. Read and M. Torrado, 2009). A material that fully capable of absorbing and re-emitting all EM energy that it receives is called a blackbody, but it is very rare and most natural objects only absorb some of the energy (Tempfli K. et al., 2009). The difference in how objects absorb and reflect energy is what’s make every earth’s feature has it’s own signature characteristic. This signature characteristic is recorded as digital number (DN) in each pixel of remote sensing data using the sensors.

In remote sensing, there are lots of sensors that mainly categorized as two types, passive and active and they are used for different applications (*insert citation*). Most sensors use passive systems which can only capture the reflection of sun’s energy and work during daylight.  The orbit of this type of sensors sometimes are set to follow’s the sun which called sun synchronous. The electromagnetic spectrum recorded by the sensors range from ultraviolet (UV), visible (red, green, blue), infrared (IR), and microwave. Meanwhile, active remote sensing can radiate it’s own energy and measure the amount of radiation returned to the sensor. This type of sensors commonly can penetrate through clouds and won’t be affected by daylight or weather conditions. Example of active sensors included SAR and LIDAR.

Although remote sensing is great for collecting data in inaccessible area and relatively cheaper for mapping large areas, there are 4 type of resolution that needs to be considered when using: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric. Spatial resolution refers to the size of area measured which is represented by each pixel. Spectral refer to the range of wavelength the sensor is sensitive to. Radiometric refer to the difference in radiation intensity, but it does not mean sensitivity. Temporal characteristics refer to the time of image acquisition. These resolutions need to be considered based on the purpose of the mapping.

## Example of Landsat and Sentinel Reflectance

Landsat program is the longest running project for acquisition of repetitive multispectral data of the Earth’s surface with as Landsat 1 the first space-based satellite for it. The current Landsat satellite that still operates are Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 with the recorded data from earlier Landsat mission are still being used in many remote-sensing applications.
