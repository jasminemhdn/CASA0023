# Introduction to Google Earth Engine (GEE)

## Summary: GEE Function and Interface

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based remote sensing data processing that allows us to access huge variety of open-source remote sensing product such as Landsat, Sentinel, and MODIS or raster product made by other people such as Impervious Surface. To use GEE, we must create an account first using Google account. GEE is connected directly to Google Drive, so we can save the unprocessed or already processed data into Google Drive and download it in case we want to use it for processing or lay outing the maps in GIS application such as QGIS. However, if the data too big, it would require large Google Drive space. Another alternative to store the processed data or present the maps online is by using Asset and Web Apps. This allows us to access the data we have already processed before for another analysis.

JavaScript is the main programming language used in GEE. But, we could also use Python when GEE is connected to Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook or QGIS. Even though it seems that JavaScript is harder to understand, GEE provides explanation of every syntax in Docs Panel. The picture below shows the GEE interface.

And this is the explanation of each part of the interface:

-   Script Panel: this panel store the scripts that has been saved and it allows us to create and load scripts.

-   Docs Panel: store the documentation and function description of GEE commands.

-   Assets Panel: a storage space to upload raster or vector data in GEE.

-   Console Panel: displays outputs, print statements, and errors when running scripts.

-   Map Panel: display geospatial datasets and analysis results.

-   Task Manager: manages long-running tasks like exporting images, tables, or maps.

-   Inspector Panel: allows us to click on the map and inspect pixel values.

-   Get Link: generate a shareable URL for the script and map view.

-   Save: save the current script.

-   Run: executes the script and applies it to the Map Panel.

-   Reset: clears all variables, print outputs, and layers.

-   Apps: provides access to custom web apps created in GEE.

-   Search Bar: find datasets, function, or scripts.

The picture below shows the example of MODIS Terra data catalog in GEE. In this catalog, there are information containing data availability, description of the data, raster bands and its spatial resolution, terms of use, citation, and dois. If we want to use this data, we can click IMPORT button in bottom right.
